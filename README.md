### Design and Structure

The design of the website consists of 3 separate pages which all have consistent navigation, hero image, footer and structure.

The colour of the website was decided to be light blue to convey a fresh look of a beach holiday.

The main goal of the business is to provide a personal service to find a perfect holiday for the visitor.

### Wireframes

[Wireframes of the initial design can be found in the PDF.](assets/images/documentation/wireframes.pdf)

## Features

### Current features

These are the features that have already been implemented on the website.

#### Navigation
There is a consistent navigation structure on all website pages which links to Home, Offers, and Contact pages. The current page the user is on is displayed in bold. This has 2 forms:

For smaller screens

![Smaller Screens Navigation](assets/images/documentation/menu-smaller-screens.jpg) 

For larger screens

![Larger Screens Navigation](assets/images/documentation/menu-larger-screens.jpg) 

#### Hero image
This shows the name of the organisation and the image conveys the colour of blue skies expected on most holidays. This is shown on every page.

![Hero image](assets/images/documentation/hero-image.jpg)

The text and image also resizes on different device screens.

#### Footer

This is shown at the bottom of all pages and contains the telephone number to contact the business and links to all the social networks.

On larger screens, the contact number is on the left hand side and the social media links are on the right hand side.

![Footer on larger screens](assets/images/documentation/footer-larger-screens.jpg)

On smaller screens the contact number is above the social media links.

### Features the site could have

If there was more time in this phase of the project then the following could be implemented:

- There could be more offers on the offers page (probably 6).
- There could be a form for visitors to sign up for special offers.


### Features the site won't have (for now)

In future iterations, the following possible features could be added:

- Auto-completion of the form with holiday details when clicking on the "Enquire" button on the offers.
- Additional fields could be added to the contact form asking for information such as departure dates, destinations required and budget.
- An online payment system for visitors to pay for holidays that they have booked.
